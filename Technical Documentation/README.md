## High-level sequence diagrams
This section presents high-level sequence diagrams that illustrate the interaction between system components during key use cases in the art marketplace system. The diagrams show communication between the client, frontend, backend API, database, and external services.

### 1.	Artist registration
* Goal: Create a new artist account while ensuring valid input and preventing duplicate registrations.
* Actors/Components:
    - **Artist (Client)**: Enters registration details and submits the form.
    - **App Frontend**: Collects user input and sends registration request to backend.
    - **Backend API**: Validates input, checks email uniqueness, hashes password, and creates user and artist profile.
    - **Database**: Stores user and artist profile records and checks for existing email.

<p align="center">
  <strong>Figure 4: Artist Registration Sequence Diagram</strong><br><br>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/495fd6f0-9839-4cf0-bc0c-77eb99d0121f" width="600"/>
  </p>
The artist fills the registration form, and the frontend sends the request to the backend. The backend validates input data and checks whether the email already exists. If the email is already registered, an error is returned. Otherwise, the password is hashed, and both the user and artist profile records are created in the database. A success response is then returned to the frontend.

### 2.	Login
* Goal: Allow a user to log in securely using their email and password.
* Actors / Components:
    - **User (Client)**: Enters email and password to access the system.
    - **App Frontend**: Sends login request and displays response to the user.
    - **Backend API**: Validates credentials, verifies password, and generates access token.
    - **Database**: Retrieves user record based on email.

<p align="center">
  <strong>Figure 5: Login Sequence Diagram</strong><br><br>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edfa1020-30ca-48c1-83ba-4b0a7ab7c16c" width="600"/>
  </p>
The user enters their email and password in the frontend. The frontend sends a login request to the backend API. The backend retrieves the user record from the database using the email.
The backend then verifies the password. If the credentials are valid, the system generates and returns an access token. If the credentials are invalid, an error message is returned to the frontend.

### 3.	Artist uploads a new artwork
* Goal: An artist uploads a new artwork by entering details and uploading an image.
* Actors / Components 
    - **Artist (Client)**: Provides artwork details and uploads image.
    - **App Frontend**: Sends artwork data and image to backend.
    - **Backend API**: Verifies artist account, processes request and creates artwork records.
    - **Database**: Stores artwork and artwork image records.
    - **Image Storage**: Stores uploaded image and returns its URL.

<p align="center">
  <strong>Figure 6: Artist uploads a new artwork Sequence Diagram</strong><br><br>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16c577d6-69e8-4e99-865a-746d5901caa4" width="600"/>
  </p>
The artist submits artwork details and an image. The backend verifies the artist account, uploads the image to storage, and receives the image URL. Then, it creates the artwork and artwork image records in the database and returns a success response.

### 4.	Customer order
* Goal: A customer places an order by adding items to the cart and completing payment.
* Actors / Components 
    - **Customer (Client)**: Adds items to cart and initiates checkout.
    - **App Frontend**: Sends cart and order requests to backend and displays results.
    - **Backend API**: Handles business logic (availability check, total calculation, order creation).
    - **Database**: Stores cart, order, and order items; updates artwork stock.
    - **Payment Service**: Processes payment and returns success or failure.

<p align="center">
   <strong>Figure 7: Customer order sequence diagram</strong><br><br>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/918d6c47-277b-44ab-bf26-0d9e5a6eb5cf" width="600"/>
  </p>
The customer adds items to the cart, and the backend checks artwork availability and updates the cart. During checkout, the backend calculates totals and sends a payment request. Once payment is successful, the system creates the order and order items, updates stock, clears the cart, and returns confirmation.

## SCM and QA Plans

### 1. Source Code Management (SCM) Plan:
The LOVEN project uses **Git** and **GitHub** as the primary tools for source code management, following the **GitHub Flow** branching strategy to support organized and collaborative development.

The workflow includes:
* A main branch that contains the stable and production-ready version of the project.
* Creating separate feature branches for each task, feature, or documentation update (e.g., ```feature/login```, ```docs/project-charter```).
* Using **pull requests (PRs)** to propose changes and review them before merging into the main branch.
* Performing code reviews to ensure code quality, consistency, and correctness before approval.
* Writing clear and descriptive commit messages to track changes and maintain a readable project history.
* Following branch naming conventions to keep the repository organized.
* Resolving merge conflicts carefully before integrating changes.
This structured workflow ensures better collaboration among team members, reduces conflicts, and maintains a clean and traceable development process.

The team uses **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as the main development environment, which is integrated with **Git** and **GitHub** to manage version control, track changes, and support collaboration.

### 2. Quality Assurance (QA) Plan
To ensure the **LOVEN** application is reliable, secure, and production-ready, a comprehensive **end-to-end (E2E)** testing strategy is implemented alongside **unit** and **integration** testing.

#### 1. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E testing validates complete user journeys across the entire system, from frontend to backend and external services. Key scenarios include:

- ```User registration``` → ```login``` → ```profile access```
- ```Browsing artworks``` → ```adding to cart``` → ```checkout``` → ```payment``` → ```order confirmation```
- ```Artist uploading artwork``` → ```listing``` → ```customer purchase``` → ```shipment update```

These tests ensure that all system components (frontend, backend API, database, and third-party services) work together correctly.

#### 2. API Testing

APIs are tested using Postman and command-line tools (e.g., curl) to verify:

- Request/response correctness
- Authentication handling
- Error responses and edge cases

#### 3. Integration Testing

Integration tests verify communication between:

- Frontend and backend
- Backend and database
- Backend and external services (payments, storage, notifications)

#### 4. Functional & User Flow Testing

Manual testing is conducted on critical user flows to validate usability and correctness:

- Authentication (register/login/logout)
- Artwork browsing and filtering
- Cart and checkout process

#### 5. Security Testing

- Authentication and authorization validation
- Token handling and protected routes
- Input validation and error handling

#### 6. Regression Testing

Performed after each major update to ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.

#### 7. Database Testing

Ensures:

- Data consistency and integrity
- Correct CRUD operations
- Proper handling of relationships (users, artworks, orders)

## Technical Justification

### 1. Flutter for Cross-Platform Development
Flutter was chosen because it allows the development of both Android and iOS applications using a single codebase. This significantly reduces development time and effort compared to building separate native applications. This choice aligns with the scope of the project as an MVP, where time and resources are limited, enabling faster delivery without compromising quality.

### 2. Mobile App over Web Application
A mobile application was selected instead of a web application to provide better accessibility and user engagement. Mobile apps allow users to easily browse artworks, make purchases, and receive real-time updates. This decision fits the scope of the system, as the platform focuses on frequent user interaction and benefits from mobile-specific features such as push notifications.

### 3. High Performance UI with Flutter
Flutter provides high performance because it compiles directly to native code, resulting in smooth animations and fast rendering. This is especially important for the LOVEN platform, where users interact with image-heavy content such as artwork listings. Ensuring a responsive UI within the scope of the MVP enhances user experience without requiring complex frontend optimization.

### 4. UI/UX Design Tools – Figma & Canva
Figma was used to design the mobile UI mockups for the LOVEN application, including screens such as Login, Home, Artwork Details, Cart, Orders, and the Artist Dashboard. It supports rapid prototyping and easy iteration, which is essential within the scope of an MVP, where quick design validation is needed.

Canva was used to design the application logo due to its simplicity and efficiency in creating visual assets. It allows the team to produce professional-quality branding without requiring advanced design skills, making it suitable for the project’s limited scope and resources.

### 5. Python for Rapid Development
Python was selected as the backend programming language due to its simplicity and readability, which enables rapid development and easier collaboration. This makes it highly suitable for the limited scope and timeframe of an MVP, allowing the team to efficiently implement core features.

### 6. Flask as a Lightweight Backend Framework
Flask was chosen because it is a lightweight and flexible web framework that provides only the essential tools needed to build RESTful APIs. It avoids unnecessary complexity, making it ideal for the project scope, where a simple and maintainable backend is sufficient.

### 7. RESTful API Design
The backend follows a RESTful API design to ensure clear and standardized communication between the frontend and backend. This approach simplifies integration with the Flutter application and supports future scalability. It aligns with the scope of the system by providing a structured yet flexible architecture.

### 8. PostgreSQL for Relational Data Management
PostgreSQL was selected as the database because it provides strong support for relational data and ensures data integrity. The LOVEN system relies on structured relationships between entities such as users, artworks, and orders. This choice fits the scope of the application, where reliable data management is essential.

### 9. Containerization using Docker
Docker was used to containerize the application, ensuring a consistent development and execution environment across different machines. This eliminates issues related to dependency conflicts and environment configuration differences between team members. It also simplifies setup and deployment processes. This choice aligns with the scope of the project, as it improves development efficiency and collaboration without introducing unnecessary complexity.
