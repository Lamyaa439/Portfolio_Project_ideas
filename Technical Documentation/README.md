## High-level sequence diagrams
This section presents high-level sequence diagrams that illustrate the interaction between system components during key use cases in the art marketplace system. The diagrams show communication between the client, frontend, backend API, database, and external services.

### 1.	Artist registration
* Goal: Create a new artist account while ensuring valid input and preventing duplicate registrations.
* Actors/Components:
    - **Artist (Client)**: Enters registration details and submits the form.
    - **App Frontend**: Collects user input and sends registration request to backend.
    - **Backend API**: Validates input, checks email uniqueness, hashes password, and creates user and artist profile.
    - **Database**: Stores user and artist profile records and checks for existing email.

<p align="center">
  <strong>Figure 4: Artist Registration Sequence Diagram</strong><br><br>
  <img src= "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d82c56c2-a075-471b-915b-8eb7c7947c55" width="600"/>
  </p>
The artist fills the registration form, and the frontend sends the request to the backend. The backend validates input data and checks whether the email already exists. If the email is already registered, an error is returned. Otherwise, the password is hashed, and both the user and artist profile records are created in the database. A success response is then returned to the frontend.

### 2.	Login
* Goal: Allow a user to log in securely using their email and password.
* Actors / Components:
    - **User (Client)**: Enters email and password to access the system.
    - **App Frontend**: Sends login request and displays response to the user.
    - **Backend API**: Validates credentials, verifies password, and generates access token.
    - **Database**: Retrieves user record based on email.

<p align="center">
  <strong>Figure 5: Login Sequence Diagram</strong><br><br>
  <img src= "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/301365fd-36be-44c6-a340-77f89d44888b" width="600"/>
  </p>
The user enters their email and password in the frontend. The frontend sends a login request to the backend API. The backend retrieves the user record from the database using the email.
The backend then verifies the password. If the credentials are valid, the system generates and returns an access token. If the credentials are invalid, an error message is returned to the frontend.

### 3.	Artist uploads a new artwork
* Goal: An artist uploads a new artwork by entering details and uploading an image.
* Actors / Components 
    - **Artist (Client)**: Provides artwork details and uploads image.
    - **App Frontend**: Sends artwork data and image to backend.
    - **Backend API**: Verifies artist account, processes request and creates artwork records.
    - **Database**: Stores artwork and artwork image records.
    - **Image Storage**: Stores uploaded image and returns its URL.

<p align="center">
  <strong>Figure 6: Artist uploads a new artwork Sequence Diagram</strong><br><br>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce3b176f-0e40-4e58-b3b6-54105babddd9" width="600"/>
  </p>
The artist submits artwork details and an image. The backend verifies the artist account, uploads the image to storage, and receives the image URL. Then, it creates the artwork and artwork image records in the database and returns a success response.

### 4.	Customer order
* Goal: A customer places an order by adding items to the cart and completing payment.
* Actors / Components 
    - **Customer (Client)**: Adds items to cart and initiates checkout.
    - **App Frontend**: Sends cart and order requests to backend and displays results.
    - **Backend API**: Handles business logic (availability check, total calculation, order creation).
    - **Database**: Stores cart, order, and order items; updates artwork stock.
    - **Payment Service**: Processes payment and returns success or failure.

<p align="center">
   <strong>Figure 7: Customer order sequence diagram</strong><br><br>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20204dfd-38f3-4764-b5d9-1b7f38969be1" width="600"/>
  </p>
The customer adds items to the cart, and the backend checks artwork availability and updates the cart. During checkout, the backend calculates totals and sends a payment request. Once payment is successful, the system creates the order and order items, updates stock, clears the cart, and returns confirmation.

## SCM and QA Plans

### 1. Source Code Management (SCM) Plan:
The LOVEN project uses **Git** and **GitHub** as the primary tools for source code management, following the **GitHub Flow** branching strategy to support organized and collaborative development.

The workflow includes:
* A main branch that contains the stable and production-ready version of the project.
* Creating separate feature branches for each task, feature, or documentation update (e.g., ```feature/login```, ```docs/project-charter```).
* Using **pull requests (PRs)** to propose changes and review them before merging into the main branch.
* Performing code reviews to ensure code quality, consistency, and correctness before approval.
* Writing clear and descriptive commit messages to track changes and maintain a readable project history.
* Following branch naming conventions to keep the repository organized.
* Resolving merge conflicts carefully before integrating changes.
This structured workflow ensures better collaboration among team members, reduces conflicts, and maintains a clean and traceable development process.

The team uses **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as the main development environment, which is integrated with **Git** and **GitHub** to manage version control, track changes, and support collaboration.

### 2. Quality Assurance (QA) Plan
To ensure the **LOVEN** application is reliable, secure, and production-ready, a comprehensive **end-to-end (E2E)** testing strategy is implemented alongside **unit** and **integration** testing.

#### 1. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E testing validates complete user journeys across the entire system, from frontend to backend and external services. Key scenarios include:

- ```User registration``` → ```login``` → ```profile access```
- ```Browsing artworks``` → ```adding to cart``` → ```checkout``` → ```payment``` → ```order confirmation```
- ```Artist uploading artwork``` → ```listing``` → ```customer purchase``` → ```shipment update```

These tests ensure that all system components (frontend, backend API, database, and third-party services) work together correctly.

#### 2. API Testing

APIs are tested using Postman and command-line tools (e.g., curl) to verify:

- Request/response correctness
- Authentication handling
- Error responses and edge cases

#### 3. Integration Testing

Integration tests verify communication between:

- Frontend and backend
- Backend and database
- Backend and external services (payments, storage, notifications)

#### 4. Functional & User Flow Testing

Manual testing is conducted on critical user flows to validate usability and correctness:

- Authentication (register/login/logout)
- Artwork browsing and filtering
- Cart and checkout process

#### 5. Security Testing

- Authentication and authorization validation
- Token handling and protected routes
- Input validation and error handling

#### 6. Regression Testing

Performed after each major update to ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.

#### 7. Database Testing

Ensures:

- Data consistency and integrity
- Correct CRUD operations
- Proper handling of relationships (users, artworks, orders)
  

## Technical Justification

## Frontend Platform & Technology (Mobile + Flutter)

### 1. Flutter for Cross-Platform Development

It was chosen over other native development (```Kotlin```/```Swift```) to eliminate platform duplication and reduce maintenance overhead. While native apps may offer slightly better platform-specific optimizations, Flutter provides sufficient performance for an image-driven marketplace while significantly accelerating development and release cycles.

It also reduces overall development effort by avoiding the need to build and maintain separate applications for different platforms. This aligns with the project scope as an MVP, where time and resources are limited and rapid delivery is a priority without compromising quality.


### 2. Mobile-First Approach vs Web Application

A mobile-first approach was selected instead of a web application due to the nature of user interaction within the platform. The system relies on frequent engagement, real-time updates, and personalized experiences, which are better supported in mobile environments.

Mobile applications enable:
- push notifications
- persistent sessions
- and tighter integration with device capabilities.

While web applications offer broader accessibility and easier deployment, they lack the same level of real-time engagement and user retention mechanisms required for this use case.


### 3. Performance Advantages of Flutter

Flutter compiles directly to native code, which enables smooth animations and efficient UI rendering—particularly important for an image-heavy marketplace like LOVEN.

Unlike frameworks such as ```React Native```, which rely on a ```JavaScript``` bridge, Flutter provides more consistent performance across devices. The main trade-off is a larger application size, which is acceptable within the scope of this project.



### 4. UI/UX Design Tools (Figma & Canva)


#### UI/UX Design Tools
To support efficient design and rapid iteration, lightweight and collaborative design tools were selected for both interface design and branding.

| Tool | Justification | Trade-off |
| :--- | :------------ | :-------- | 
| Figma | Enables real-time collaboration, rapid prototyping, and efficient design-to-development handoff | Requires internet access and may have performance limits on large files |
| Canva | Quick and easy creation of branding assets like logos without advanced design skills | Less flexible and powerful than professional tools like Adobe Illustrator |


## Backend Development (Python & Flask)

### 5. The choice of Python and Flask

* Python
Python was selected as the backend language due to its readability and rapid development capabilities, which improve team productivity and simplify implementation of business logic. It allows faster iteration compared to alternatives such as Node.js, especially for teams prioritizing clarity and maintainability.

* Flask
Flask was chosen as the web framework due to its lightweight and flexible design. Unlike full-stack frameworks such as Django, Flask does not enforce strict structures, allowing the team to build a clean, modular RESTful API tailored to the system’s needs. While this requires more manual configuration, it avoids unnecessary complexity and provides greater control over the application architecture.

### 6. RESTful API Design
The backend follows a RESTful API design to ensure clear and standardized communication between the frontend and backend. This approach simplifies integration with the Flutter application and supports future scalability. It aligns with the scope of the system by providing a structured yet flexible architecture.

### 7. PostgreSQL for Relational Data Management
PostgreSQL was selected as the database because it provides strong support for relational data and ensures data integrity. The LOVEN system relies on structured relationships between entities such as users, artworks, and orders. This choice fits the scope of the application, where reliable data management is essential.

### 8. Containerization using Docker
Docker was used to containerize the application, ensuring a consistent development and execution environment across different machines. This eliminates issues related to dependency conflicts and environment configuration differences between team members. It also simplifies setup and deployment processes. This choice aligns with the scope of the project, as it improves development efficiency and collaboration without introducing unnecessary complexity.

### 9. ACID Compliance for Transactions
**PostgreSQL** was configured to ensure **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** compliance for all database transactions. In a marketplace like **LOVEN**, where a single purchase involves multiple steps—such as deducting stock, creating an order record, and confirming payment—ACID properties guarantee that either all steps succeed or none do. This prevents data corruption and ensures that the system remains in a consistent state, which is critical for maintaining user trust and financial accuracy.

### 10. Use of External Payment Gateway (Moyasar)
**Moyasar** was integrated as the primary payment gateway to handle financial transactions securely. By offloading payment processing to a specialized provider, the system ensures compliance with **PCI DSS** standards without the need to store sensitive credit card information on the local server. Moyasar was specifically chosen for its robust support of local payment methods in Saudi Arabia, such as **Mada and Apple Pay**, which enhances the user experience and facilitates seamless transactions within the target market.

### 11. Firebase Cloud Storage (FCS) for Media Handling
The integration of **Firebase Cloud Storage (FCS)** via a **Direct-to-Cloud** architecture is a strategic decision designed to maximize system performance and scalability. By offloading binary data ingestion to Google’s specialized infrastructure, we eliminate the backend bottleneck, significantly reducing upload latency and freeing up server CPU and RAM for core business logic. This approach adheres to the **Separation of Concerns** principle, keeping the Flask backend stateless and lightweight while leveraging a **Global CDN** to ensure near-instant image delivery to users worldwide. Furthermore, this design optimizes operational costs by reducing server bandwidth consumption and prevents "orphaned storage" through a backend-controlled cleanup mechanism using the **Firebase Admin SDK**. Ultimately, this architecture ensures that the LOVEN platform remains responsive and resource-efficient, even as the high-resolution artwork catalog scales exponentially.

### 12. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Notifications
**Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** was selected as the optimal push notification infrastructure for the LOVEN MVP due to its strategic alignment with our tech stack and operational efficiency. Since the frontend is built with **Flutter**, FCM provides a seamless "One Codebase" advantage, acting as a universal translator that reliably delivers notifications to both iOS and Android devices without the need to maintain separate logic for APNs and Android services. On the backend, the official **Python Admin SDK** allows for painless integration with Flask, enabling instant notification dispatch using the user's stored `fcm_token` without building complex HTTP requests. Crucially, unlike custom WebSocket solutions that drop when an app is closed, FCM connects directly at the OS level, guaranteeing delivery even when the app is in the background or fully terminated. Furthermore, it delivers this enterprise-grade, highly scalable notification system at **zero cost** for standard messages, making it the perfect resource-efficient choice for validating the MVP.

### 13. JWT for Secure Authentication
**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** were adopted for secure, stateless authentication between the Flutter frontend and the Flask backend. JWT allows the server to verify user identity without the need to maintain session data in memory, which enhances system scalability. Each request is authenticated via a signed token, ensuring that sensitive actions—such as managing an artist profile or completing a purchase—are protected against unauthorized access.

### 14. UUIDs for Resource Identification
The system utilizes **UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers)** instead of sequential integers for identifying all primary resources (Users, Artworks, Orders). This approach enhances security by preventing **ID enumeration attacks**, where malicious actors could guess resource URLs by incrementing IDs. Additionally, UUIDs provide a future-proof foundation for database sharding or merging, ensuring that identifiers remain unique across different distributed systems.

### 15. Modular System Architecture (Facade & Repositories)
A **Modular Architecture**—incorporating the **Facade and Repository patterns**—was implemented to ensure a strict **Separation of Concerns**. The Repository layer abstracts database interactions, while the Facade layer orchestrates complex business logic. This modularity makes the codebase significantly easier to test, maintain, and scale. It also allows the team to modify specific components, such as changing a third-party service or updating database logic, with minimal impact on the rest of the system.
