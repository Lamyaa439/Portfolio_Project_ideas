"""
Artwork facade.

Acts as the orchestrator for artwork listing API flows. Delegates all business
logic to artwork_service.

Image handling: the mobile app uploads artwork images directly to Firebase
Storage and sends the resulting URL as artwork_image_url in the JSON body.
This layer does not accept multipart files or perform cloud storage operations.
